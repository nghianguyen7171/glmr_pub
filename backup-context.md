## Change Log
- Installed `PyPDF2` and extracted report text to enable grading of PDF submissions.
- Reviewed reports for Groups 1–8 under `Midterm_AI_Project` and assigned report quality scores.
- Combined report assessments with presentation feedback from `presentation_raking.csv` to rank teams and select the top two submissions.
- Added `docs/` GitHub Pages scaffolding (`_config.yml`, `index.md`, `issue-1.md`, `scoring-summary.md`) and catalogued every midterm PDF as an Issue 1 article with download links.
- Overhauled journal styling with custom layouts, Elsevier-inspired cards, and per-report article pages (see `docs/_layouts/journal.html`, `docs/_layouts/article.html`, `docs/articles/`).
- Enhanced Issue 1 cards with English titles, editorial highlights, and inline GitHack readers; created detailed articles for Groups 1–8.
- Decorated the homepage with highlights, metrics, and featured articles; added `README.md` documenting structure, workflow, and deployment steps.

## Notes
- Group 9 and Group 10 have no reports in `Midterm_AI_Project`; only Groups 1–8 were scored this session.
- GitHub Pages is configured to serve from `docs/`. Key entry points: `docs/index.md`, `docs/issue-1.md`, `docs/scoring-summary.md`, and per-report pages in `docs/articles/`.
