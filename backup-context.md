## Change Log
- Installed `PyPDF2` and extracted report text to enable grading of PDF submissions.
- Reviewed reports for Groups 1–8 under `Midterm_AI_Project` and assigned report quality scores.
- Combined report assessments with presentation feedback from `presentation_raking.csv` to rank teams and select the top two submissions.
- Added `docs/` GitHub Pages scaffolding (`_config.yml`, `index.md`, `issue-1.md`, `scoring-summary.md`) and catalogued every midterm PDF as an Issue 1 article with download links.

## Notes
- Group 9 and Group 10 have no reports in `Midterm_AI_Project`; only Groups 1–8 were scored this session.
- To publish the journal, enable GitHub Pages with the `docs/` directory as the source. The landing page is `docs/index.md`, Issue 1 is `docs/issue-1.md`, and the scoring summary is duplicated at `docs/scoring-summary.md` for web delivery.
