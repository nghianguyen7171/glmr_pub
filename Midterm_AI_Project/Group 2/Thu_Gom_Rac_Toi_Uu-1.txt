1 Introduction
In the domain of urban management, the efficient collection of municipal solid waste (MSW) is a
critical logistical operation essential for maintaining public health, environmental sustainability,
and fiscal responsibility. Suboptimal routing strategies for waste collection vehicles lead to ex-
cessive fuel consumption, increased operational costs, higher carbon emissions, and undue strain
on municipal resources. This complex logistical challenge can be modeled as the Traveling Sales-
man Problem (TSP) or the Hamiltonian Path Problem (HPP), and more broadly as a Vehicle
Routing Problem (VRP), which is a well-known NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization.
The VRP, in its essence, can be viewed as an extension of the TSP. In the context of waste
collection, the depot represents the starting and ending point, the collection bins are the nodes
(or "cities") that must be visited, and the road network forms the weighted edges of the graph.
The objective is to determine a sequence of collection points that forms the shortest possible
tour, beginning and ending at the depot while visiting each required location exactly once to
save fuel, reduce operational costs, and increase collection efficiency.
The relevance of solving this optimization problem extends far beyond theoretical computer sci-
ence and waste management. The core principles of route optimization are fundamental to a
wide array of modern logistical challenges, including package delivery for e-commerce, tourist
itinerary planning, and the navigation of autonomous robots in warehouses and manufactur-
ing facilities. As urban systems and supply chains grow in complexity, the need for intelligent,
automated routing systems becomes paramount. Therefore, understanding the computational
trade-offs of different search strategies provides crucial insights for developing robust platforms
for a multitude of real-world applications.
In this study, we apply and evaluate three foundational search algorithms for the waste collection
routing problem: Breadth-First Search (BFS) as a baseline uninformed search, Greedy Best-First
Search (GBFS) with a straight-line distance heuristic, and the A* search algorithm using the
sum of the path cost and the Manhattan distance as its heuristic function. We will compare their
performance based on the total length of the generated route (solution quality), the number of
nodes expanded (search space efficiency), and overall computational time, thereby assessing the
applicability of these AI search methodologies for a tangible, real-world optimization task.

2 Problem Formulation
2.1 State Space Representation
The optimal route planning problem for waste collection, modeled as a Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP), can be formally defined as a search problem with the following components:
State Space (S):Each state is represented by a tuple(current_city, visited_cities),
wherecurrent_cityis the node the collection vehicle is currently at, andvisited_cities
is the set of all nodes (waste bin locations) that have already been visited. The environ-
ment is a weighted graph where nodes represent locations and edges represent roads with
associated travel distances.
Initial State (s 0):The starting configuration,(Depot, {Depot}), where the vehicle begins its
route at the main depot.
Goal State (s G):A state where all required waste bins have been visited and the vehicle has
returned to the depot. This is represented as(Depot, {All_Bins∪Depot}).
Actions (A):The set of possible actions from any state is to move from thecurrent_cityto
an adjacent, unvisited citynext_cityalong a valid edge in the graph.
Transition Model:Given a states= (u, V)and an action of moving to an adjacent cityv,
the resulting state iss′= (v, V∪ {v}).
Path Cost:The cost of a path is the sum of the distances (weights) of all edges traversed. The
objective is to find a path from the initial state to the goal state with the minimum total
path cost.
2.2 Heuristic Functions
Two heuristic functions are employed in this study for the informed search algorithms:
Dijkstra-based Nearest Neighbor Heuristic (h 1):UsedforGreedyBest-FirstSearch. This
heuristic estimates the cost to the goal by finding the shortest path from the current node
to thenearestunvisited waste bin. The algorithm repeatedly calculates the shortest path
to the next closest goal, making it a greedy approach. It does not consider the overall path
structure.
Minimum Spanning Tree Heuristic (h 2):Used for A* Search. This is a more complex and
admissible heuristic that estimates the cost to complete the tour. It is calculated as:
h(n) =Cost(MST remaining ) +Cost( min
edge_out) +Cost( min
edge_in)
Where:
•Cost(MST remaining )is the cost of the Minimum Spanning Tree connecting all unvisited
waste bins.
•Cost(min edge_out )is the cost of the shortest edge from the current nodento one of
the unvisited bins.
•Cost(min edge_in )is the cost of the shortest edge from any unvisited bin back to the
starting depot.
This heuristic is admissible because the cost of an optimal tour is always greater than or
equal to the cost of any spanning tree on the same set of nodes.

3 Algorithms
This section describes the three search algorithms applied to solve the waste collection routing
problem.
3.1 Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
UCS is an uninformed search algorithm that explores the state space by expanding the node with
the lowest path cost (g(n)) from the start node. It systematically explores paths in increasing
order of cost.
Characteristics:UCS does not use a heuristic function. It is equivalent to Dijkstra’s algorithm
and guarantees finding the optimal (least-cost) route if all edge costs are non-negative.
However, its efficiency degrades significantly in large state spaces as it explores in all
directions without a goal-oriented guide.
Complexity:ThetimecomplexityforaTSP-likeproblemisfactorial,approximatelyO(n! log(n!)).
Its space complexity is proportional to the number of expanded nodes, which can become
very high for larger problems.
3.2 Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)
GBFS is an informed search algorithm that expands the node that appears to be closest to
the goal, using only the heuristic functionh(n)to make its decision. In this study, it uses the
Dijkstra-based nearest neighbor heuristic (h 1).
Characteristics:Byprioritizingtheheuristicestimate, GBFSisoftenveryfastandrequiresless
memory. It is suitable for problems where a quick, reasonably good solution is sufficient.
However, because it ignores the path cost already incurred (g(n)), it does not guarantee
an optimal solution.
Complexity:The time complexity depends heavily on the quality of the heuristic but is gener-
ally better than uninformed search, roughlyO(n2logn)in this implementation. The space
complexity is low.
3.3 A* Search
A* is an informed search algorithm that combines the advantages of UCS and GBFS. It aims to
find the shortest path by using an evaluation functionf(n) =g(n) +h(n).
Characteristics:A* balances the cost to reach the current node (g(n)) with an estimated cost
to the goal (h(n)). When used with an admissible heuristic, such as the Minimum Spanning
Tree heuristic (h 2), A* is both complete and optimal. It is significantly more efficient than
UCS because the heuristic guides the search toward the goal.
Complexity:The time complexity is highly dependent on the accuracy of the heuristic but can
be factorial in the worst case (O(n! log(n!))). The space complexity is also a concern as it
stores all generated nodes in memory.

The task was formulated as a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where the starting and end-
ing point was node"Le Duan". The number of intermediate waste bins to visit (n) increased
incrementally from 2 to 12. The performance of UCS, GBFS, and A* was compared based on
the path cost, execution time, and number of expanded nodes.
The following code snippets represent the core logic of each algorithm tested.

4.3 Evaluation
Based on the experimental data, the performance of the algorithms varies significantly with the
scale of the problem.
Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)consistently delivered the fastest results with the lowest
number of expanded nodes. This is expected, as its heuristic-only approach prunes the search
space aggressively. However, its trade-off is optimality — for problems withn≥8, it failed to
find the least-cost path.
Uniform Cost Search (UCS)guaranteed an optimal solution but at a significant computa-
tional price. The number of expanded nodes and the execution time grew exponentially with
n, making it impractical for larger-scale problems. Its performance is acceptable only for very
small instances.
A* Searchalso provided optimal solutions in all cases. While it was slower for small values ofn
(due to the overhead of computing the heuristic), its superiority became evident as the problem
scaled. Forn= 12, A* expanded approximately 35 times fewer nodes than UCS, demonstrating
its effectiveness in managing combinatorial explosion and providing a better balance between
optimality and performance.
In conclusion, while GBFS is suitable for scenarios where speed is critical and a near-optimal
solution is acceptable, A* remains the most robust choice for finding guaranteed optimal routes
in problems of moderate to large complexity.

5 Real-world Application Insight
The choice of algorithm for a real-world routing problem depends on the specific constraints and
objectives of the application, such as the scale of the operation, the need for optimality, and the
tolerance for computational delay.
5.1 Uniform Cost Search Applications
Given its guarantee of optimality but high computational cost, UCS is best suited for small-scale,
static environments where the optimal route can be pre-calculated and followed repeatedly. The
overhead is justified because the path is guaranteed to be the most efficient. Practical examples
include route planning for autonomous robots in a small factory or warehouse, or a fixed daily
garbage collection route in a small, well-defined residential block.
5.2 Greedy Best-First Search Applications
The primary advantage of GBFS is its speed, making it ideal for large-scale applications where
real-time responsiveness is more critical than guaranteed optimality. A "good enough" solution
delivered quickly is often preferable to a perfect solution that takes too long to compute. This
makes it suitable for consumer-facing map applications that provide driving directions, route
planningforcity-widedeliverydroneswhereconditionsmaychangedynamically, orprogramming
robotic vacuum cleaners in large office buildings.
5.3 A* Search Applications
A* offers a powerful balance between optimality and performance, making it the most versatile
algorithm for a wide range of logistics and planning problems. It is the preferred method for
medium to large-scale operations where efficiency directly translates to significant cost savings
and thus, optimality is a requirement. Key applications include route optimization for inner-
city delivery fleets, scheduling for transport robots in large automated fulfillment centers, and
planning paths for drones delivering critical medical supplies, where both speed and efficiency
are paramount.

6 Other Heuristic Functions
Beyond the traditional Greedy and A* methods, several advanced heuristics have been developed
to improve the efficiency and quality of solutions for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
Among them, two of the most powerful and widely used are the1-Tree (Held–Karp Bound)
and theAssignment (Hungarian Lower Bound). Both provide very tight lower bounds that
significantly enhance the performance of A* and other search algorithms.
6.1 1-Tree Heuristic (Held–Karp Bound)
The 1-Tree heuristic is one of the most classical and effective lower bounds for TSP. It constructs
aMinimum Spanning Tree (MST)onn−1nodes, excluding one selected node (often the
starting city). Then, it connects this excluded node back to the tree using its two cheapest
edges. The resulting structure, known as a1-Tree, provides a lower bound for the optimal TSP
tour cost because it relaxes the requirement that each node must have exactly two incident edges.
Advantages:
•Produces a very tight and admissible lower bound for the TSP.
•Efficient to compute using MST algorithms such as Prim or Kruskal.
•Performs extremely well in practice and is widely used in branch-and-bound solvers.
Limitations:
•Requires recomputation or adjustment when applied dynamically during A* search.
•Bound quality may slightly depend on which node is excluded.
Complexity:O(n2logn)
Comparison with A*:When used within A*, the 1-Tree heuristic allows the algorithm to
prune a large portion of the search space by providing a close approximation of the optimal path
cost. Although it introduces additional computational overhead compared to simpler heuristics
(like MST), the trade-off is beneficial for medium-sized instances where search reduction greatly
outweighs per-state computation.
6.2 Assignment Heuristic (Hungarian Lower Bound)
The Assignment heuristic models the remaining unvisited nodes as acost assignment prob-
lem, where each city must be “assigned” to another with minimal transition cost. By applying
theHungarianAlgorithm, theheuristicfindstheminimumtotalassignmentcost, whichserves
as a strong lower bound on the cost to complete the tour.
Advantages:
•Provides one of the tightest admissible lower bounds for TSP.
•The heuristic is theoretically grounded in combinatorial optimization, ensuring consistency.
•Highly effective for small to medium-sized problems and near-optimal in practice.
Limitations:
The Optimal Route Planning Problem for Waste Collection - Semester 1 Page 13/15
Faculty of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
•Computationally expensive with time complexityO(n3).
•Difficult to recompute for every node during large-scale A* search.
Complexity:O(n3)
Comparison with A*:Incorporating the Hungarian Lower Bound into A* greatly improves
pruning capability. Because the bound is very tight—often close to the true optimal cost—A*
expands far fewer nodes than when using MST or simple distance-sum heuristics. However, the
high computation cost per evaluation limits its practicality for large graphs, making it more
suitable for smaller or highly constrained TSP instances.
6.3 Comparison
Both 1-Tree and Assignment heuristics offer significantly better performance than classical ad-
missibleheuristicssuchasMSTorMinimumMatching. The1-Treeheuristicachievesanexcellent
balance between accuracy and computational cost, making it ideal for dynamic A* implemen-
tations. Meanwhile, the Assignment heuristic provides the tightest theoretical bound, achieving
near-optimal performance at the expense of higher time complexity.
In short:
•1-Tree (Held–Karp Bound):Best trade-off between efficiency and tightness.
•Assignment (Hungarian Lower Bound):Most accurate, but computationally heavier.
When combined with A*, both heuristics substantially reduce search space and improve conver-
gence toward the optimal TSP tour.
