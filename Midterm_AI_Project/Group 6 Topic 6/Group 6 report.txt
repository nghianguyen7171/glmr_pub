 1 Introduction 
Emergencies such as fires, earthquakes, or terrorist incidents in crowded 
environments pose significant threats to human life. In these situations, ensuring a rapid 
and safe evacuation becomes a critical concern for event organizers and public safety 
authorities. A single delay or misjudgment in finding the nearest exit can result in severe 
injuries or fatalities. As modern events like museum exhibitions, stadium concerts, or 
conferences often attract thousands of participants, the design of intelligent eva cuation 
systems capable of identifying optimal escape routes has become an important research area in Artificial Intelligence (AI).  
Evacuation planning can be modeled as a state space search problem , where 
individuals navigate through a structured environment —such as a building or maze —to 
reach the nearest safe exit. Each possible position corresponds to a state , and moving from 
one point to another constitutes a state transition . The challenge lies in determining the 
sequence of movements that minimizes both time and distance, while adapting to dynamic conditions such as congestion or blocked paths. By representing this scenario as a maze 
pathfinding problem , AI search algorithms can be systematicall y analyzed and 
compared in a controlled environment before being applied to real-world contexts. 
In this study, we focus on three fundamental search algorithms that represent distinct 
approaches to problem-solving in AI: 
•Breadth -First Search (BFS) —a systematic, exhaustive algorithm that explores
all possible paths level by level to guarantee the discovery of the shortest possible
route .
•Depth -First Search (DFS) —a recursive strategy that explores deeply along one
direction before backtracking, which can quickly find a path but does not ensureoptimality.
•Greedy Best -First Search (GBFS) —a heuristic -based method that uses an
evaluation function (in this case, Manhattan distance) to estimate how close a node
is to the goal, prioritizing speed over accuracy.
These algorithms are applied to a simulated maze environment  that represents a 
simplified model of a real building layout, such as a conference hall or exhibition area. 
Faculty  of Data Science  and Artificial  Intelligence  
 
Maze Pathfinding -  Semester  1  Page  3/15  
 By using randomly generated mazes of varying complexity, the study evaluates algorithm 
performance under different spatial constraints. Metrics such as runtime , memory 
consumption, and path optimality  are used to assess each algorithm’s strengths and  
weaknesses.  
Beyond theoretical comparison, this research emphasizes practical implications . For 
example, in a large museum like the A80 or a stadium with multiple exits, an algorithm 
that can quickly generate near -optimal escape routes may be more valuable than one that 
guarantees perfect accuracy but is too slow to respond in real time. Thus, the trade -off 
between optimality  and efficiency is central to this analysis.  
Furthermore, this work forms the foundation for developing agent -based evacuation 
simulations (ABS), where each individual is modeled as an intelligent agent capable of 
independent decision- making. Integrating search algorithms like BFS and GBFS into 
such simulations allows researchers to study collective evacuation behavior, congestion dynamics, and the impact of environmental variables such as smoke or blocked exits. 
In summary, the goals of this project are:  
•To model evacuation planning as a maze-based search problem.
•To apply and compare BFS, DFS, and GBFS algorithms across various mazeconfigurations.
•To evaluate algorithmic performance based on efficiency, optimality, andresource consumption.
•To derive insights that can guide real -world evacuation planning and AI -driven
safety systems.
Through this comparative analysis, we aim to bridge the gap between theoretical 
search algorithms and their real -world applications in emergency management and 
intelligent building systems . 
2 Problem Formulation 
To represent real -world evacuation dynamics, the environment is modeled as a two -
dimensional maze . Each cell corresponds to a possible position that an individual can 
occupy. 
Faculty  of Data Science  and Artificial  Intelligence  
 
Maze Pathfinding -  Semester  1  Page  4/15  
 •Start position (S): Represents a person’s initial location.
•Walls (# ): Represent obstacles, booths, or inaccessible areas.
•Exits (E): Represent safe escape points.
The goal is to find the shortest  and safest path  from  S to the nearest E while avoiding 
obstacles.  
2.1 State Representation  
•Each state defines a position (x, y) in the maze grid.
•Successor states are reachable by moving up, down, left, or right.
•The transition model defines legal moves that do not cross walls.
•The cost of each move is uniform (1 unit).
2.2 Heuristic Function for GBFS  
Since no dynamic cost data is provided (e.g., smoke or congestion), GBFS employs 
the Manhattan distance  as the heuristic:  
∣∣ 𝑥𝑥𝑎𝑎−𝑥𝑥𝑏𝑏∣∣𝑀𝑀 =∣ 𝑥𝑥𝑎𝑎1−𝑥𝑥𝑏𝑏1∣+ ∣ 𝑥𝑥𝑎𝑎2−𝑥𝑥𝑏𝑏2∣ 
This heuristic estimates the distance from the current position to the nearest exit and 
guides the search efficiently toward the goal. 
3 Algorithms  
3.1 Maze Generation  
The maze serves as a simplified representation of a real -world environment such as a 
building floor plan, exhibition hall, or stadium. To construct the maze, we employ the 
DFS backtracking algorithm , which generates what is known as a perfect maze —a 
structure where there exists exactly one unique path between any two open cells. The 
algorithm operates by recursively visiting cells, carving pathways, and backtracking when 
necessary until all cells are accessible.  
Faculty  of Data Science  and Artificial  Intelligence  
 
Maze Pathfinding -  Semester  1  Page  5/15  
 However, perfectly generated mazes are often too structured and predictable. To 
better simulate real -world evacuation scenarios, where multiple alternative routes and 
intersections exist, we introduce controlled randomness by selectively removing a small 
proportion of walls after the initial generation. This process results in an imperfect maze, 
containing loops, branching corridors, and multiple exits. The inclusion of these  
irregularities mirror realistic conditions such as alternate doors, interconnected  rooms, 
and unexpected detours. 
Each maze is stored as a two-dimensional grid matrix , where: 
•. represents a traversable cell .
•# represents a wall or obstacle.
•S marks the starting position  (the initial location of a person or agent).
•E denotes one or more exit points  (the safe destinations) .
This structure facilitates flexible adaptation to different algorithms, allowing the same 
environment to be explored using BFS, DFS, and GBFS for direct performance comparison. 
We adapted the Python code for Perfect Mazes from the dataset available at Kaggle . 
The original code was modified and extended by adding new features developed by us. 
3.2 Search Methods  
Three classical search algorithms are implemented to navigate through the maze from 
the starting point to the nearest exit.  
Breadth -First Search (BFS)  
# Breadth- First Search 
from collections import deque 
def bfs(grid): 
 sta rt,  exits, rows, cols = parse_maze( grid) 
 q = de que([start ]) 
 par ent = {} 
 vis ited = {start} 
 whi le q : 
Faculty  of Data Science  and Artificial  Intelligence  
 
Maze Pathfinding -  Semester  1  Page  6/15  
  cu r = q.popleft()  
 if cur in ex its: 
 retur n reconstruct_path( parent, cur) 
 f or  nb in neighbors (cur, rows, cols, grid): 
 if  nb not in visited:  
 v isited.add(nb) 
 p arent[nb] = cur 
q.ap pend(nb)
 ret urn  None 
BFS explores the maze level by level , visiting all nodes at the current depth before 
expanding deeper levels. It employs a queue data structure, ensuring that the first 
discovered path to an exit is also the shortest possible path . While BFS guarantees 
optimality, it requires maintaining a record of all visited nodes and frontier nodes, leading to high memory consumption , especially in large mazes. Despite this limitation, BFS 
serves as a reliable benchmark for evaluating other algorithms.  
Depth -First Search (DFS)  
# Depth-First Search  
def dfs(grid): 
 sta rt,  exits, rows, cols = parse_maze( grid) 
 sta ck = [start] 
 par ent = {} 
 vis ited = {start} 
 whi le stack: 
 cu r = stack.pop() 
 if cur in ex its: 
 retur n reconstruct_path( parent, cur) 
 f or  nb in neighbors (cur, rows, cols, grid): 
 if  nb not in visited:  
 v isited.add(nb) 
 p arent[nb] = cur 
 s tack.append(nb) 
 ret urn  None 
DFS explores as far as possible along one direction before backtracking. It  utilizes a 
stack structure (or recursion) to keep track of exploration. While DFS  may quickly reach 
a goal if it happens to choose the correct path early, this  does not guarantee finding the 
shortest route. In dense or looping mazes, DFS can become inefficient, revisiting the same 
regions multiple times and consuming unnecessary computation. Nevertheless, its 
Faculty  of Data Science  and Artificial  Intelligence  
 
Maze Pathfinding -  Semester  1  Page  7/15  
 simplicity and low per -step overhead make it an important algorithm for baseline  
comparison. 
Greedy Best -First Search (GBFS)  
GBFS introduces a heuristic- based evaluation function, prioritizing nodes that 
appear closest to the goal according to an estimated cost function ℎ(𝑛𝑛). In this study, we 
use the Manhattan Distance heuristic : 
∣∣ 𝑥𝑥𝑎𝑎−𝑥𝑥𝑏𝑏∣∣𝑀𝑀 =∣ 𝑥𝑥𝑎𝑎1−𝑥𝑥𝑏𝑏1∣+ ∣ 𝑥𝑥𝑎𝑎2−𝑥𝑥𝑏𝑏2∣ 
# Greedy Best- First Search  
import heapq 
def manhattan( a, b): 
 ret urn  abs(a[0]-b[0]) + abs(a[1]-b[1]) 
def gbfs(grid): 
 sta rt,  exits, rows, cols = parse_maze( grid) 
 def h(node ): 
 re turn min(manhattan( node, e) for e in exits) 
 hea p = [(h(start), start)] 
 par ent = {} 
 vis ited = {start} 
 whi le heap: 
 _, cur = hea pq.heappop(heap) 
 if cur in ex its: 
 retur n reconstruct_path( parent, cur) 
 f or  nb in neighbors (cur, rows, cols, grid): 
 if  nb not in visited:  
 v isited.add(nb) 
 p arent[nb] = cur 
 h eapq.heappush (heap, (h(nb), nb)) 
 ret urn  None 
The algorithm selects the next node to expand based on the lowest heuristic value, 
aiming to move rapidly toward the goal. GBFS can significantly reduce search time and 
memory usage, but heuristic inaccuracies may mislead it, leading to suboptimal paths or 
local minima . However, its speed and efficiency  render it appropriate for real -time 
applications like emergency navigation or robot pathfinding.

 3.3 Benchmarking and Evaluation Metrics  
To ensure fair and consistent performance assessment, we implement a 
benchmarking function that executes each algorithm on multiple randomly generated 
maze instances.  The following evaluation metrics are recorded: 
•Average runtime (seconds) —measures computational efficiency.
•Peak memory usage (bytes) —indicates the space complexity of each  algorithm.
•Path optimality (steps) —represents how close the discovered route is to the true
shortest path.
This multi- metric analysis enables both quantitative and qualitative comparison, 
highlighting the trade-offs between computational cost, accuracy, and responsiveness. 
4 Experiment and Results 
4.1 Experimental  Setup  
Experiments are conducted across a series of mazes with increasing dimensions—
5×5, 7×7, 51×51, and 201×201 grids—to assess algorithm scalability. Each maze includes 
one starting point (S)  and multiple  exits (E)  strategically positioned at the boundaries 
to mimic real building layouts. For each maze size:  
•100 random maze instances are generated using the DFS backtracking method.
•Each algorithm (BFS, DFS, GBFS) is executed 100 times  on distinct maze
configurations.
•The average runtime, peak memory consumption, and path length are
computed.
All algorithms are implemented in Python using standardized data structures to ensure 
consistency. Timing and memory measurements are captured using built -in profiling 
tools. Each experiment is repeated multiple times to reduce random variability and 
measurement noise.

 4.2 Performance Analysis  
Small- scale Mazes (5×5  and 7x7)  
#5x5 
Benchmark results over 100 mazes  (5x5 , 2 exits):  
BFS: avg runtime 0.000351s, avg peak memory 2.23 KB , 
avg pat h length 3.64  
DFS: avg runtime 0.000378s, avg peak memory 1.73 KB,  
avg pat h length 5.96  
GBFS: avg runtime 0.000380s , avg peak memory 2.03 KB,  
avg pat h length 3.64  
#7x7 
Benchmark results over 100 mazes  (7x7 , 2 exits):  
BFS: avg runtime 0.000599s, avg peak memory 2.61 KB , 
avg path length 6.94 
DFS: avg runtime 0.000659s, avg peak memory 2.69 KB,  
avg pat h length 11.67  
GBFS: avg runtime 0.000610s, avg peak memory 2.23 KB,  
avg pat h length 6.95  
At small maze sizes, all algorithms complete successfully in negligible time (below 1  
ms on average). BFS consistently produces the shortest paths , as expected, while DFS 
and GBFS achieve similar performance with minor deviations in path length. In such 
limited environments, memory and runtime differences are statistically insignificant, 
demonstrating that the choice of algorithm has little practica l effect for small evacuation 
areas.  
Medium -scale Mazes ( 51×51)  
#51x51 
Benchmark results over 100 mazes  (51x 51, 4 exits): 
BFS: avg runtime 0.009952s, avg peak memory 31.46 KB , 
avg path length 140.28 
DFS: avg runtime 0.011884s, avg peak memory 56.58 KB,

avg pat h length 144.02 
Faculty  of Data Science  and Artificial  Intelligence  
 
Maze Pathfinding -  Semester  1  Page  10/15  
 As maze complexity increases, the performance divergence becomes more apparent. 
BFS continues to guarantee the shortest route but exhibits noticeable memory overhead  
due to its exhaustive search strategy. DFS begins to display variability depending on the 
maze layout; in certain cases, it finds a route quickly, while in others, it becomes trapped 
in long dead -end paths. GBFS shows the best balance  at this scale —completing searches 
faster than BFS while maintaining near-optimal path quality. 
Large-scale Mazes (201×201)  
#201x201  
Benchmark results over 100 mazes (201x201, 10 exits):  
BFS: avg runtime 0.179215s, avg peak memory 182.08 KB , 
avg path length 564.80 
DFS: avg runtime 0.211539s, avg peak memory 618.96 KB,  
avg pat h length 2985.14  
GBFS: avg runtime 0.192165s, avg peak memory 101 .64 KB, 
avg pat h length 592.63 
In large and complex mazes, the performance gap becomes substantial : 
•BFS maintains accuracy but consumes exponentially higher memory, making it
less feasible for real -time systems.
•DFS  becomes unstable and inefficient, often revisiting large sections of the maze
and occasionally failing to terminate within reasonable time limits.
•GBFS , while designed to be faster by using the Manhattan heuristic to guide the
search, can sometimes become slower when multiple exits are present, since it
must repeatedly compute heuristic values for each possible goal. (With a smarterand faster heuristic th an Manhattan, GBFS could perform even better)
4.3 Summary of findings  
The comparative results demonstrate that each algorithm offers distinct advantages 
depending on the situation:

In real- world applications, BFS  is preferred when the shortest path is essential (e.g., 
pre-planned evacuation routes). GBFS  is ideal for time -sensitive operations, such as live 
crowd management or robotic guidance. DFS , while less efficient, remains a useful 
educational and analytical tool for understanding search behavior.  
5 Discussion 
The comparative analysis of BFS, DFS, and GBFS across multiple maze 
configurations highlights both the theoretical and practical implications of each algorithm 
in evacuation pathfinding. While the experiments focus on abstract maze environments, 
the insights derived can be effectively extended to real -world evacuation systems , 
particularly in large- scale public events such as stadiums, museums, or conference 
venues. 
5.1 Algorithmic Insights and Trade -offs 
Each search algorithm exhibits unique characteristics that influence its suitability for 
emergency evacuation applications.  
•Breadth -First Search  ensures that the path discovered is always optimal  in terms
of the fewest number of moves or shortest distance to an exit. This makes BFS a
reliable choice for situations where accuracy and safety  take precedence over
computation time. However, the cost of such optimality is exponential growth in
Faculty  of Data Science  and Artificial  Intelligence  
 
Maze Pathfinding -  Semester  1  Page  12/15  
 memory usage  and processing time, particularly in large environments with many 
open pathways. Thus, BFS is most appropriate for offline evacuation planning , 
such as verifying building layouts or precomputing emergency routes before an 
event takes place.  
•Depth -First Search , due to its simple recursive structure, requires relatively low
setup overhead and minimal auxiliary data structures. However, its tendency topursue deep branches before backtracking often leads to inefficient exploration,especially in dense or looping mazes. In evacuation contexts, DFS could result inlong detours or dead ends , making it unreliable for real -time decision systems.
Nevertheless, it remains valuable as a baseline algorithm  for educational or
prototype purposes, illustrating the importance of exploration order in searchproblems.
•Greedy Best -First Search  introduces a heuristic -driven approach that provides a
strong trade -off between speed and optimality. By prioritizing nodes with smaller
Manhattan distances to the nearest exit, GBFS can produce solutions faster  than
BFS, while still maintaining near- optimal path quality. This balance makes GBFS
particularly well- suited for dynamic evacuation systems , autonomous robots ,
or intelligent guidance systems where rapid computation is essential and small
deviations from the optimal path ar e acceptable.
5.2 Real-world Applications and Implementation Scenarios  
The insights gained from maze -based pathfinding extend naturally to evacuation 
modeling  in complex infrastructures. In practical terms, these algorithms can be 
embedded in digital systems for: 
1.Evacuation Route Optimization: Identifying the shortest or fastest paths to exits
for crowd control systems in real time.
2.Guidance Robots and Smart Displays:  Providing adaptive navigation
instructions in venues using GBFS or hybrid algorithms (e.g., A*).
3.Safety Policy Simulation: Allowing planners to test various evacuation layouts
under simulated crowd conditions before events occur.
Moreover, hybrid methods  combining BFS’s completeness with GBFS’s efficiency 
(such as the A* algorithm) could further improve the balance between speed and accuracy. These methods can integrate additional dynamic factors such as crowd density , 
smoke propagation , or blocked exits  to better reflect real emergency conditions.

Maze Pathfinding -  Semester  1  Page  13/15  
 5.3 Case Study: Evacuation Simulation in the A80 Stadium  
To demonstrate the practical applicability of the algorithms, we conducted a 
simulation experiment  based on the A80 Stadium , a large event venue frequently 
hosting thousands of spectators. The A80 layout was represented as a grid- based map 
with five main exits  and multiple internal pathways connecting seating areas, corridors, 
and open spaces. Each person inside the stadium was modeled as an autonomous agent , 
each with independent movement, perception, and decision -making capabilities.  
Simulation Design  
•Each agent  begins from a random location within the stadium, representing a
spectator’s position at the onset of an emergency.
•Walls and booths  are modeled as obstacles, and exits  correspond to doors leading
outside the venue.
•Each agent applies one of the tested algorithms —BFS, DFS, or GBFS —to find
the nearest available exit.
•Agents move simultaneously, and congestion is simulated: when too many agents
occupy the same cell or corridor, their movement speed decreases proportionallyto local crowd density.
•Agents continuously update their chosen routes; if congestion near an exitbecomes severe, they can recalculate and switch  to an alternative exit.
Insights and Implications  
The A80 case study shows that how well an algorithm works in theory has a real effect 
on how well it works in practice during an evacuation. While BFS remains the gold 
standard for route optimality, GBFS emerges as the most pragmatic choice for real-
time evacuation management due to its balance between computational efficiency and practical effectiveness. In dynamic, unpredictable environments, the ability to react swiftly often outweighs the need for mathematical perfection.  
These findings suggest that integrating GBFS -based pathfinding into agent -based 
simulation platforms  and smart building management systems  can significantly 
improve emergency response efficiency. Moreover, hybrid methods such as A* —
combining BFS’s optimal guarantees with GBFS’s heuristic speed —hold promise for 
next-generation evacuation technologies.

 6 Conclusion  
This study explored the application of classical search algorithms —Breadth -First 
Search , Depth -First Search , and Greedy Best -First Search —to model and solve the 
evacuation pathfinding problem  in complex environments. By representing evacuation 
routes as maze- based search tasks, we systematically analyzed the trade- offs between 
computational cost, optimality, and real-world usability. 
The experimental results across mazes of varying complexity clearly demonstrate 
distinct algorithmic characteristics:  
•BFS produces the shortest and safest paths but is computationally expensive.
•DFS  is highly dependent on path direction and often inefficient.
•GBFS , guided by Manhattan distance, provides the best balance between speed
and practicality.
Future Works  
While this study provides foundational insights, several directions remain open for 
future research:  
•Hybrid Search Methods:  Combining BFS’s completeness with GBFS’s speed
•(as in A*  or Weighted A* algorithms) to achieve optimality and efficiency
simultaneously.
•Dynamic Heuristics:  Incorporating real -time factors —such as heat, smoke, and
human density—into heuristic functions for more realistic modeling.
•Parallel and Distributed Search:  Leveraging multi -core or cloud computing to
handle large- scale, multi -agent evacuation simulations efficiently.
•Machine Learning –Enhanced Heuristics:  Training neural networks to learn
heuristic estimates from simulation data, enabling adaptive and intelligent
decision-making.
•Real -World Implementation:  Integrating these algorithms into IoT -enabled
smart buildings or emergency response systems for field testing and validation.

 Final Remarks  
In conclusion, this research demonstrates how fundamental AI search algorithms can 
be adapted and evaluated for life-critical applications  such as evacuation planning. 
Among the algorithms studied, GBFS emerges as the most practical solution , offering 
a strong balance between computational speed and route effectiveness.  
The A80 case study further illustrates how heuristic -guided strategies can reduce 
evacuation times and improve safety outcomes in large -scale events.  
By bridging the gap between theoretical AI models and real-world safety systems , 
this study contributes to the growing field of intelligent evacuation planning —where 
artificial intelligence not only enhances efficiency but also helps protect human lives in 
times of crisis.
